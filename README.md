# Survey form with React

In this project we were supposed to build a survey form in React to practise React state and controlled forms.

## The problem

I started the project with sketching up how I wanted the survey to look like and wrote what kind of questions I wanted to have in the survey. I wanted it to be a fun survey with some questions about which type cats is the most popular, and by answering the survey you could win cat food for a whole year.
At first I found it hard to build the components and wrote all of the code in App.js. After a while I felt that I should try to split them up and put them in different files. I thought that was difficult at the beginning but after a while I started to understand how I was supposed to write the code.

The most difficult part was how to get the data into App.js and how to immport the different components.

If I had more time I would have tried another background image, or ad a different background image to the summary page.
